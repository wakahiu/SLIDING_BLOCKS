SLIDING_BLOCKS

Block Game

From CS61BL U.C Berkeley Summer 2011

Those of you who spend much time in toy stores may be familiar with "sliding-block" puzzles. They consist of a number of rectangular blocks in a tray; the problem is to slide the pieces without lifting any out of the tray, until achieving a certain configuration.
