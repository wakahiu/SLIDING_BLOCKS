SLIDING_BLOCKS
==============

Block Game

From CS61BL U.C Berkeley Summer 2011

Those of you who spend much time in toy stores may be familiar with "sliding-block" puzzles. They consist of a number of rectangular blocks in a tray; the problem is to slide the pieces without lifting any out of the tray, until achieving a certain configuration.

Further Description can be found in the following link ( http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61bl/su11/resources/proj3/index.html )
